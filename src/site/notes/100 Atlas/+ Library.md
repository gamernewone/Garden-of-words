# Library
Navigate your library of maps with a classification system made for PKM. 

### The LYT Classification System
While I encourage you to fully customize your **home** note, I urge you to start building your library using the **LYT Classification System**. 

The **LYT Classification System** is lightly modified from the Cutter, Dewey, and Universal Decimal classification systems used in libraries around the world. It will provide you a time-tested foundation as you structure the interests of your digital library.

## 000 - Knowledge Management
The [[100 Atlas/MOCs/My PKM MOC|My PKM MOC]] shows the best practices of knowledge management. I use the [[LYT Kit|LYT Kit]] to show the power of linked thinking and to empower others to develop their thinking. The [[Mapping MOCs|Mapping MOCs]] is my personal note to wrap my head around the wondrous beauty that MOCs offer. Others include:

- [[Knowledge and memory MOC|Knowledge and memory MOC]]

## 100 - Personal Management
The [[100 Atlas/MOCs/Thinking|Thinking]] MOC can galvanize my attention; the [[100 Atlas/MOCs/Concepts MOC|Concepts MOC]] can flavor it; and the [[Habits MOC|Habits MOC]] speaks about how to direct it. Go to [[500 Spaces/1 - Life/‚Ä¢ MOCs/Life Space‚Ñ¢|Life Space‚Ñ¢]] to see the [[Virtue List|Virtue List]] and more.

Others: [[Posture MOC|Posture MOC]] and [[Hormesis MOC|Hormesis MOC]] and [[Breathing Exercises MOC|Breathing Exercises MOC]].

## 200 - Philosophy ü§î, Psychology üß†; Spirituality üôè , Religion „ä™
Is there no limit to this section? I use [[100 Atlas/MOCs/Philosophy MOC|Philosophy MOC]] as the big note and then point to things like: [[Stoicism MOC|Stoicism MOC]], [[Confucianism MOC|Confucianism MOC]], [[Religion MOC|Religion MOC]], [[Taoism MOC|Taoism MOC]], and whatever else comes up.

[[100 Atlas/MOCs/Library/Psychology MOC|Psychology MOC]]is similar but different enough to have its own space.

## 300 ‚Äì Social Sciences üë•
*The study of human society and of individual relationships in and to society.*
While this a very important section, I have found it's a bit more intimate, as strange as that sounds, so I'm hesitant to share too much here. That said, the [[100 Atlas/MOCs/People MOC|People MOC]] is special note, along with [[100 Atlas/Scopes/Prominent People üåã|Prominent People üåã]].



See also: Politics | Society | Law | Relationships | [[100 Atlas/MOCs/Library/Economy MOC|Economy MOC]]

## 400 ‚Äì Communications & Rhetoric; Language & Linguistics üó£
A fun section of the library, the 400s contains the underrated and oft-maligned subject of [[Rhetoric MOC|Rhetoric MOC]]. And one cannot talk long about rhetoric without talking about [[100 Atlas/MOCs/Library/Languages MOC|Languages MOC]], [[Words MOC|Words MOC]], and especially [[Figures MOC|Figures MOC]]. Not too far behind is the [[Leadership MOC|Leadership MOC]].

See also: [[100 Atlas/MOCs/Library/Com Studies MOC|Com Studies MOC]] | [[100 Atlas/MOCs/Library/Linguistics MOC|Linguistics MOC]] | [[Commonplace MOC|Commonplace MOC]] | [[100 Atlas/MOCs/Library/Wisdom MOC|Wisdom MOC]]

## 500 - Natural Sciences
A sharp break from the previous section, the 500s explores the natural world and universe in glorious notes like [[Cosmology MOC|Cosmology MOC]] and [[Math MOC|Math MOC]]. 

See also: Chemistry | Geology | Plants | Animals | [[100 Atlas/MOCs/Library/Mathematics MOC|Mathematics MOC]]

## 600 - Applied Sciences
A natural progression from the previous section, this is where we take the fundamentals of nature and *apply* them.

See also: [[100 Atlas/MOCs/Library/Engineering MOC|Engineering MOC]] | Agriculture | Technology | Medical | [[100 Atlas/MOCs/Library/AI MOC|AI MOC]] | [[100 Atlas/MOCs/Library/Collective Intelligence MOC|Collective Intelligence MOC]] | [[Genetics MOC|Genetics MOC]] | [[100 Atlas/MOCs/Library/Systems MOC|Systems MOC]] | [[100 Atlas/MOCs/Library/Comp Science MOC|Comp Science MOC]]

## 700 - Art & Recreation
Ah the leisures of life. Remember leisure? Few really do. This section could easily balloon. 
- Art MOC | [[Design MOC|Design MOC]] | Architecture | Painting | 
- Film & TV | [[Movies MOC|Movies MOC]] 
- Sports | [[Football MOC|Football MOC]] 
- Music | [[Jazz MOC|Jazz MOC]] | [[Vocals MOC|Vocals MOC]] 
- [[Cooking MOC|Cooking MOC]] | Leisure 
- `#source/movieüé¨` | `#source/tvüé¨` | `#source/musicüéµ` 

## 800 - Literature
If folks barely remember leisure, they likely completely forgot about classical literature. A great shame, neomania...we blind ourselves to some of humanity's greatest hits. Use [[Literature MOC|Literature MOC]] as a launchpad.

## 900 - History & Biography & Geography
I've noticed I'm naturally building up the [[Ancient Greece MOC|Ancient Greece MOC]], but I haven't cared to build out the [[100 Atlas/MOCs/Library/History MOC|History MOC]] just yet. The [[100 Atlas/MOCs/Library/Places MOC|Places MOC]] is a peculiarly powerful note that has big things in store for it.

The [[Art & Science Storytelling MOC|Art & Science Storytelling MOC]] look at some great storytellers of history.

## Commentary
Please don't go overboard with numbering things. We‚Äôre just using a basic pre-made map as a fixed *spatial constellation* upon which to easily add dots of new interests. Too much structure stifles innovation and organic, emergent growth.
