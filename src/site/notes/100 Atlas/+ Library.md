This is a map of everything I externalized. My lowly thought may come handy for something in the future.

## 000 - Knowledge Management
The [PKM MOC]] different way of managing knowledge. Others include:



## 100 - Personal Management
The [[100 Atlas/MOCs/Thinking|Thinking]] MOC can galvanize my attention; the [[100 Atlas/Scopes/Concepts MOC|Concepts MOC]] can flavor it; and the [[Habits MOC|Habits MOC]] speaks about how to direct it. Go to [[500 Spaces/1 - Life/Life Space‚Ñ¢|Life Space‚Ñ¢]] to see the [[Virtue List|Virtue List]] and more.



## 200 - Philosophy ü§î, Psychology üß†; Spirituality üôè , Religion „ä™
Is there no limit to this section? I use [[100 Atlas/MOCs/Philosophy MOC|Philosophy MOC]] as the big note and then point to things like: [[Stoicism MOC|Stoicism MOC]], [[Confucianism MOC|Confucianism MOC]], [[Religion MOC|Religion MOC]], [[Taoism MOC|Taoism MOC]], and whatever else comes up.

[[100 Atlas/MOCs/Library/Psychology MOC|Psychology MOC]]is similar but different enough to have its own space.

## 300 ‚Äì Social Sciences üë•
*The study of human society and of individual relationships in and to society.*
While this a very important section, I have found it's a bit more intimate, as strange as that sounds, so I'm hesitant to share too much here. That said, the [[100 Atlas/MOCs/People MOC|People MOC]] is special note, along with [[100 Atlas/Scopes/Prominent People üåã|Prominent People üåã]].

## 400 ‚Äì Communications & Rhetoric; Language & Linguistics üó£
A fun section of the library, the 400s contains the underrated and oft-maligned subject of [[Rhetoric MOC|Rhetoric MOC]]. And one cannot talk long about rhetoric without talking about [[100 Atlas/MOCs/Library/Languages MOC|Languages MOC]], [[Words MOC|Words MOC]], and especially [[Figures MOC|Figures MOC]]. Not too far behind is the [[Leadership MOC|Leadership MOC]].

## 500 - Natural Sciences
The 500s explores the natural world and universe in glorious notes like [[Cosmology MOC|Cosmology MOC]] and [[Math MOC|Math MOC]]. 

See also: Chemistry | Geology | Plants | Animals | [[100 Atlas/MOCs/Library/Mathematics MOC|Mathematics MOC]]

## 600 - Applied Sciences
A natural progression from the previous section, this is where we take the fundamentals of nature and *apply* them.

## 800 - Literature


## 900 - History & Biography & Geography
I've noticed I'm naturally building up the [[Ancient Greece MOC|Ancient Greece MOC]], but I haven't cared to build out the [[100 Atlas/MOCs/Library/History MOC|History MOC]] just yet. The [[100 Atlas/MOCs/Library/Places MOC|Places MOC]] is a peculiarly powerful note that has big things in store for it.

The [[Art & Science Storytelling MOC|Art & Science Storytelling MOC]] look at some great storytellers of history.
