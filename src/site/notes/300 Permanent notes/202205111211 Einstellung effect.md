Our brain develop in a way to mechanize the state of the mind. That’s why the most breakthrough are made from young people or people from different field of knowledge because they don’t have Einstellung (A rigid mindset)

When you work on a field for a long time and reach a certain degree of mastery , you develop a rigid mindset (It’s like this). you stop listening to advice from other people, it make you less attuned to new info that weren’t available when you learned. You stop thinking outside the box.

>&emsp;
>Question every preconceived truth, always ask yourself “what is option c”
